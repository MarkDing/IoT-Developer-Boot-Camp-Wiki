# Welcome

Welcome to the IoT Developer Boot Camp. These pages are intended for those who is learning about the IoT development. The Boot Camp consists of various wireless products. Including Zigbee, Bluetooth, Z-Wave, Proprietary, Wireless hardware. Each of the product learning paths are divided into two parts. 

- One day workshop for the beginner. 
- Series of workshop for intermediate.

The beginner can start with the one day workshop to get familiar with basic concepts of the wireless knowledge, development environment setup, and know how to build their first IoT product from scratch. And becomes the entry level of the IoT developer. 

After that, we can continue to pickup any interesting topics from the series of workshops, focus on the real need during their development process. Become intermediate level developer. 

And for the advanced level, we'd recommended to take a deep look into the Zigbee spec from official website, and Application notes, KBA, User Guide from Silicon Labs web site. That won't be covered by our course here.  

# Start our adventure

On top of this page, you will find several small icons following with text of wireless protocol name. 

* __Zigbee, Bluetooth, ZWave and Proprietary__ are different wireless protocols
* __Hardware__ introduce the wireless hardware knowledge
* __Common__ introduce the common IoT knowledge that not limited with specific wireless protocol. 

Click on the topic you are interested to start our adventure. 

If you are complete new to IoT, It is recommended to start with [IoT Introduction](IoT-Introduction).
