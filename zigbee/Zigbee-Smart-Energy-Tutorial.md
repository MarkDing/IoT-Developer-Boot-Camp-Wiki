## 1. Introduction
Smart Energy by the Zigbee Alliance is a secure, wireless protocol designed to enable utilities to improve energy availability and reliability, and empower consumers to better understand their energy consumption habits. With over 100 million Smart Energy Certified electric and gas meters installed across the Great Britain and the United States, Smart Energy by the Zigbee Alliance has become the most important smart grid energy management protocol on the market today.  

Smart Energy by the Zigbee Alliance allows utilities and energy services providers to easily deploy residential and commercial sensors, controls, and consumer engagement devices at the point of delivery, and connect them to the millions of smart meters that have been deployed over the last decade. This infrastructure enables energy providers to:
- Communicate dynamic pricing for electricity, gas, and water
- Schedule control activity for thermostats
- Manage load control relays and building automation systems
- Give customers real-time access to electricity, gas and water metering data
- And more.  

The application will use link keys which are optional in the ZigBee and ZigBee Pro stack profiles but are required within a Smart Energy network. The Trust Center and all devices on the Smart Energy network must support the installation and use of these keys. 

Zigbee uses public/private key technology to authenticate a device joining a Smart Energy network and provides a means to securely
establish encryption keys for future transactions. The Smart Energy specification uses Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) for cryptographic
authentication and key generation.
Zigbee uses ECC with the key establishment cluster to derive a link key. It also uses ECC for creating digital signatures for software
upgrade images sent through the Zigbee Over-the-Air (OTA) Upgrade cluster.   

Certicom (www.certicom.com) provides both the certificates
and the ECC technology for use in Zigbee Smart Energy networks.
Smart Energy 1.0 used an ECC curve 163k1 with a 48-byte certificate. Smart Energy 1.2 introduced use of the ECC curve 283k1 with a
74-byte certificate. The certificates are separate and unique and are not interoperable. However when both are present on the same
device, they must contain the same 64-bit Extended Unique Identifier (EUI64). Devices may have one or both sets of security data installed.
The rules for what devices must have both certificates or what devices only need one certificate is governed by the Smart Energy
specification.  

In this tutorial, we will introduce how to finish the certificate based key exchange (CBKE) procedure with EmberZnet SDK.
&nbsp; 

## 2. Prerequisites
Zigbee Smart Energy network has higher security requirements. The APS layer security is now mandatory in Smart Energy specification whereas it's just optional in Zigbee 3.0 specification. The Smart Energy specification uses Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) for cryptographic authentication and key generation. Therefore, each Smart Energy device must support Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm and must be programed with a certificate.

To develop a Zigbee Smart Energy application with EmberZnet SDK, you have to install Simplicity Studio and then download EmberZnet SDK. This can be done following the steps in [Zigbee-Preparatory-Course](Zigbee-Preparatory-Course). Besides, you need to prepare the following resources before you start:
- ECC Library
- Smart Energy Certificates
- IAR Toolchain

### 2.1. Install Side-package for ECC Library
The ECC libraries is provided as a side-package to customer of EmberZnet. It's not released together with EmberZnet SDK. Instead, you need to apply for it through Silicon Labs' [Support Portal](https://siliconlabs.force.com/s/contactsupport). You just need to create a ticket to ask for it. Once you are granted an access permit, you will be able to see the side-package under the "SOFTWARE RELEASES" tab of your home page.  

Once you get the package, please refer to the [guide](https://www.silabs.com/community/wireless/zigbee-and-thread/knowledge-base.entry.html/2017/06/05/how_to_add_ecc_libra-IQL1) to extract the package.  

If you need to support OTA, you should copy the file "image-builder-ecc-windows.exe"(Windows) or "image-builder-ecc-linux"(Linux) to directory "protocol\zigbee\tool\image-builder" under your SDK.
&nbsp; 

### 2.2. Apply for Smart Energy Certificates
Smart Energy 1.0 utilized an ECC 163k1 curve with a 48-byte certificate format. All certified devices are required to support this.   

Smart Energy 1.2 introduces a new curve ECC 283k1, and a 74-byte certificate format. Smart Energy 1.2 devices must support the existing 163k1 ECC curve and may also support the new 283k1 curve. (The requirements for what devices must support the 238k1 ECC curve is spelled out in the ZigBee Smart Energy specification.)  

Certificates can be applied from [Certicom](https://blackberry.certicom.com/en/products/managed-certificate-service/smart-energy-device-certificate-service). There are two kinds of certificates:
- Test Certificates : used in internal development environment. 
- Production Ceertificates : used in real Smart Energy deployments.  

They are not compatible.   

Each certificate is associated with a particular EUI64 and must be used on the device with the same EUI64. In the side-packages, Silicon Labs provides two test certificates:
- certicom-test-cert-1.txt -- associated with EUI64 **0022080000000001**  
- certicom-test-cert-2.txt -- associated with EUI64 **0022080000000002**  

In this tutorial, we are going to use these two test certificates.
&nbsp; 

### 2.3. IAR Toolchain
For the time being, the ECC libraries are built with IAR. Therefore, we have to use IAR in all Smart Energy applications.

&nbsp; 

## 4. Run and Test
### 4.1. Flash Certificates
We will use Simplicity Commander flash the certificates into the devices.  

First, as the certificate certicom-test-cert-1.txt is associated with EUI64 **0022080000000001**, we have to flash this EUI64 into the device as well.   

**If the associated EUI64 matches your device, you can skip this step.**  

Edit file "certicom-test-cert-1.txt", add the following line into the end of the file (the EUI64 must be in big endian order):  
```
MFG_CUSTOM_EUI_64: 0100000000082200
```
After that, save this file, and run the following command to flash:
```
commander.exe flash --tokengroup znet --tokenfile d:\certicom-test-cert-1.txt --serialno 440126081
```

After that, flash the certificate file "certicom-test-cert-2.txt" with the same steps.  

&nbsp; 

### 4.2. Flash SoC image and NCP image
Flash the SoC image and NCP image according to the steps in [Flashing Image](Flashing-Image).

### 4.3. Check Certificate State
Run "**info**" command to check the certificate state.
