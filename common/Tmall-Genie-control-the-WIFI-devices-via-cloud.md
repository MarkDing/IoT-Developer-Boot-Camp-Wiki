# 1. Introduction

People used to regard mobile phones, TVs or routers as the control centers of smart homes until the emergence of smart speakers. It should be that you control your smart devices just by saying a sentence such as &quot;Open the light of living room&quot;, rather than by clicking on the phone screen. Now, there are so many smart speakers in market for controlling the smart device, two of the most famous are Google Home from Google and Echo from Amazon. In China, the most famous smart speaker are XiaoAi from XiaoMi and Tmall Genie from Alibaba. Now, all of these companies have developed IoT platform so that the manufacturer who produce smart homes can connect their smart productions to these smart speakers. This project is intended to introduce how to control a Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device.with TmallGenie.

The software architecture of project consists of:

*   Firmware running on EFM32GG11 STK
*   Web server running on cloud.

The hardware consists of :

*   A EFM32GG11 STK
*   A WGM110 Wi-Fi Expansion Kit
*   A Tmall Genie smart speaker.

User can control the LED0 in EFM32GG11 STK through one of two methods below.

*   Speak a command to Tmall Genie smart speaker.

<div align="center">
<img src="files/CM-Smart-Speaker/flow01.png">
</div>

*   Alibaba web server needs to obtain limited access to silabs-iot so that it can get device information and control it, get details from section 5.2 &nbsp;Authorization between Alibaba and silabs-iot .
*   Alibaba will issue a http request to silabs-iot to get all device information. The web server of silabs-iot will check the identify of visitor and then return all devices list owned by the user.
*   Alibaba get the deice information and display them in device list of Tmall Genie App.
*   User say a command to Tmall Genie.
*   Tmall genie will upload the voice to Alibaba web server.
*   Alibaba parse the voice.
*   Alibaba issue a new http request to silabs-iot according to the result of voice parsing, for example turn on light. The web server of silabs-iot will update the database after receiving&nbsp;the request from alibaba and return response immediately.
*   The device will poll the state by issue a http request periodic to silabs-iot and update itself. Get details from section 5.3 Communication between device and silabs-iot
*   Alibaba return response to Tmall Genie
*   Tmall Genie plays a voice as a repsonse of user's voice command.

## 5.2 Authorization between&nbsp; Alibaba and silabs-iot

The authorization protocol between them is based on OAuth2.0. OAuth2.0 is an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications, get more details from&nbsp; [https://oauth.net/2/](https://oauth.net/2/) . The OAuth2.0 server on this case is based on the library from Brent Shaffer, download it from GitHub:&nbsp; [https://github.com/bshaffer/oauth2-server-php](https://github.com/bshaffer/oauth2-server-php). The process is divided into the following steps, as the picture shown below.

<div align="center">
<img src="files/CM-Smart-Speaker/flow02.png">
</div>

1.  The Alibaba web server will jump into the Log in page of [silabs-iot.com](http://silabs-iot.com) when you click 3rd-party login in Tmall Genie App.
2.  Input account and password to log in, if success, the web server of silabs-iot will generate a code.
3.  Return the new code to Alibaba web server, the code only used by Alibaba and can only use once.
4.  Alibaba get the code and request an access_token to [silabs-iot.com](http://silabs-iot.com) with it.
5.  The web server of silabs-iot checks the code and identify of visitor, it will generate a access_token and refresh token if success. The access_token is time-sensitive and the time can be configured, it is 2 days in this case. The refresh_token is used to request a new access_token when the access_token is expired.
6.  Alibaba web server will store the access_token and refresh_token. Now, it can access silabs-iot with access_token.

## 5.3 Communication between device and silabs-iot

The communication between devices and web server is based on Http protocol. The device need to visit web server periodic so that it can update the LED0 once the Tmall Genie change the state of light.

<div align="center">
<img src="files/CM-Smart-Speaker/flow03.png">
</div>

1.  Device issues a new http request to silabs-iot.
2.  The web server gets the mac address and query the state in database.
3.  The web server returns the state value of the device.
4.  The device parses the http response and update LED0 according to the results.
